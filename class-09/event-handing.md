# Event Handling

Event is FIRED (or RAISED)

Code is TRIGGERED

## Event types

- click
- submit
- onChange
- hover
- on page load
- on mouse over
- on key releases

**Event listener**
: code that is TRIGGERED when an event is FIRED

**Bind**
: bind or tether an event lister to the event

**Event Handler**
: Code that runs in response to event

## Old ways to do event handling (DO NOT DO THIS!)

- In the HTML: `<article onClick=“handleClick”>`

- In the JavaScript: `element.onEvent = functionName;`
ex.: `button(document.getElementById(‘button’).onSubmit=handleEvent;`
