# Debugging

- read the error message
  - line where the error happened
  - information about the error

- checking varriables, confirm things match
- syntax highlighting

- linter in VS code

- VS code debuggers

- commenting code out to find what line of code isn't working. If the code runs without one line, but doesn't with that line, the error is probably in that line.

- console.log()

- check datatype of varriables. Ex:

```js
let x = '2';
let y = x + x;
console.log(y)
// y will equal 22 not 4 because the datatype of x is a string
```

- second set of eyes

- check the docs

- google the syntax. Ex. It's easy to forget if you need a "," or a ";"

- stack overflow

- google the error message

- ACP often
- useful comments in your code
